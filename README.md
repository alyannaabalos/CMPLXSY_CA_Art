The artwork (generated in NetLogo) exhibits Rule 99 of Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest class of 1D cellular automata. A possible current state of the left, center and right cell is taken from the configuration order 111, 110, 101,... 000, and the resulting state of the next cell in the evolution is defined by a digit from the binary representation of the integer 99 (1100011) that corresponds to the given state. The figure below illustrates the given rule:

The artwork (generated in NetLogo) exhibits Rule 150 of Elementary Cellular Automata. Starting with a single black cell, successive generations are given by interpreting the numbers 1, 7, 21, 107, 273, 1911, 5189, ... (OEIS A038184) in binary, namely 1, 111, 10101, 1101011, 100010001, ... (OEIS A118110). The figure below illustrates the given rule:
