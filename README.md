# Async Learning Task: Cellular Automata

## Artwork 1: Elementary Cellular Automata Rule 99
This artwork exhibits Rule 99 of Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest class of 1D cellular automata. A possible current state of the left, center and right cell is taken from the configuration order 111, 110, 101,... 000, and the resulting state of the next center cell is defined by the digit in the binary representation of the integer 99 that corresponds to the given state.
