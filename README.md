The artwork exhibits Rule 99 of Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest class of 1D cellular automata. A possible current state of the left, center and right cell is taken from the configuration order 111, 110, 101,... 000, and the resulting state of the evolution is defined by a digit from the binary representation of the integer 99 (1100011) that corresponds to the given state.
